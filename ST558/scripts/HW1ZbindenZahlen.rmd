# Problems

1. The iris Flower dataset.

        a.  What is the variance of sepal length?
        b. What is the covariance between Sepal Width and Petal Width?
        c. If we measured variables petal width in in instead of cm, but changed nothing 
        else, what would be the new covariance between Sepal Width and Petal Width?
        The new variance would be:
        $$$ 
        \frac{\text{old variance}}{2.54} = -.048 
        $$$

```{r}
iris_data <- read.csv("d:/zz/RepoMan/osu/data/irisData.csv")
#a
colMeans(iris_data[1:4])

#b
cov(iris_data[1:4])
```
